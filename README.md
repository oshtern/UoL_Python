# Floyd-Warshall algorithm written in recursive approach

The package includes two functions: 'calculate_shortest_path' and 'solve_paths'. 

'calculate_shortest_path' takes two nodes and a distance matrix to return the shortest path for one pair.

'solve_paths' takes in a distance matrix and returns the shortest paths for all pairs.


The tests file is included in the package with five test cases.
